# CompleteComplementaryCodes

This repo contains matlab function that generate the complete complementary codes. This codes has been used as a coded excitation sequences for increasing the SNR of sparse arrays for 3D ultrasound imaging in this ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287569)).

 If you use our code please cite our paper ;)
